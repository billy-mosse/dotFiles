Summary
=======

Uses the commandline/python-module javascript formatter from http://jsbeautifier.org/ to format the selected text, or the entire file if there is no selection. Plugin does not check to make sure the buffer has a `.js` file type, it just javascript formats the selection/file. Thus, use with caution if you are in an html file.

Install
-------

Extract the download archive, paste the JsBeautifier folder in the Sublime Text 2 "Packages" directory, which is located where ever the `Preferences` -> `Browse Packages` option in sublime takes you.

On Mac OS/X Sublime Text 2 installs it's packages into the `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages` directory. One option is to create a symbolic link from the git repository to the Packages folder.Here's how I install from the git repo on my computer:

`â†’ ln -s ~/src/oss/sublime-text/JsBeautifier ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/JsBeautifier`

Key Binding
-----------

The default key binding is `ctrl+alt+f`

Updates
-------

- 8/25/2011 - Added sublime-commands file. `Format: Javascript` now appears in the command palette
- 8/25/2011 - scrolls back to whatever line you were on prior to formatting the file (middle of screen) rather than leaving the view position at the top of the file after formatting.
